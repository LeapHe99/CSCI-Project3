# Project comment
- In this project, we realized the record of the daily operation of store. The entire code structure adopts multi-level inheritance, which greatly improves the code reuse rate and simplifies the amount of code. Because the number of customers is uncertain and often needs to be used, in this project, customers are generated using factory patterns, which improves code utilization, shortens running time, and reduces unnecessary overhead.
